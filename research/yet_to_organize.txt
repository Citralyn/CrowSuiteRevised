TODO:

// cookies, 
// and the other problem is (at least on safari) i dont think it loads state correctly
//or like certain events dont work (i think they never reaech ontime)
// maybe i just, have it run twice or something
// or make a manual btuton for it, idk
// but idk how to save game ID state 

// ya i think cookies for later 

// I hate cookies so much
i think im just going to get it working again, then ask someone abotu the cookies

// works on safari kind of, cookies may still be an issue
// i think for undefined (it updates on like socket (first) and socket (second))
I need to isolate certain parts of the code to test it
Instead of just running the whole thing each itme lol 

// i thiink i used useState correctly? i really do a need to do a write-up

// a rejoining page?
// so far only work on chrome
(bc safari has cookie issues)

// i think async messing me up

// defiinitly will ahve to do a write up on mounting
and use effecct
and all those errors 

lets think 
// player username
// their number of cards 
//if connected -> will send alert
-// if disconnected -> will send an alert

// basically -> nubmer of connected clients G
// we can just store the player_id (aka socket_id) as a map
// that will map to an object
object will have username, number of cards, player number

// player can have cards
an array
//then held and selected can just be arrays of false or true 
.. thats it for the client 
and keep track of the number 

For game state
game room 
# of players
round amount of cards
number of passes
current turn 
// have a list of the randomized cards 
// and whats in the deeck 
"" i gess it needs to handle 

Walkthrough
-> socket signs on
-> //nothing happens immediately 
-> user logs in (enters a username)
- // socket id -> gets saved as a cookie
-> also (on server end) new room gets created
-> map (with key being socketid) is saved to server with player information
// game room is fine
