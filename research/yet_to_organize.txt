TODO:
I need to isolate certain parts of the code to test it
Instead of just running the whole thing each itme lol 



lets think 
// player username
// their number of cards 
//if connected -> will send alert
-// if disconnected -> will send an alert

// basically -> nubmer of connected clients G
// we can just store the player_id (aka socket_id) as a map
// that will map to an object
object will have username, number of cards, player number

// player can have cards
an array
//then held and selected can just be arrays of false or true 
.. thats it for the client 
and keep track of the number 

For game state
game room 
# of players
round amount of cards
number of passes
current turn 
// have a list of the randomized cards 
// and whats in the deeck 
"" i gess it needs to handle 

Walkthrough
-> socket signs on
-> //nothing happens immediately 
-> user logs in (enters a username)
- // socket id -> gets saved as a cookie
-> also (on server end) new room gets created
-> map (with key being socketid) is saved to server with player information
// game room is fine
